MoS2 (Molybdenum Disulfide)

Multi-modal MoS2 analysis showing topography, resistance, and surface potential. ResiScope shows higher resistance in monolayers, decreasing exponentially with layer thickness. Combined with HD-KFM surface potential mapping, this dual analysis on the same location links structural and electronic properties, advancing nanoelectronic and optoelectronic design.

Mode: Multi-modal (ResiScope + HD-KFM)
Signals: Topography, Resistance, Surface Potential
