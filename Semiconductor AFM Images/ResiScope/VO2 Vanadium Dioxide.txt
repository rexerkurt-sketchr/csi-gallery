VO2 - Vanadium Dioxide

ResiScope image on a Metal to Insulator VO2 sample (10 microns). By controlling the thickness of the film it is possible to generate a morphology with VO2 blocks with different resistance separated by insulating VO2 walls. Thanks to the realtime adjustment of the gains it is possible to measure the resistance differences with high sensitivity.
